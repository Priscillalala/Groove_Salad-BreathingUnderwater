## Wiki
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Priscillalala/Groove_Salad-BreathingUnderwater/wiki) for a full catalogue of content. Consider this your spoiler warning!

## Manual Installation
This mod depends on the [Return Of Modding](https://github.com/return-of-modding/ReturnOfModding) loader:
* Download the latest Return Of Modding release from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/risk-of-rain-returns/p/ReturnOfModding/ReturnOfModding/versions/) or [Github](https://github.com/return-of-modding/ReturnOfModding/releases) and follow the installation instructions
    * Make sure to run the game once with Return Of Modding to generate the relevant folders
* Download this package, extract the package folder, and copy it into the `ReturnOfModding/plugins` folder. Your final folder structure should look like `ReturnOfModding/plugins/Groove_Salad-BreathingUnderwater-X.X.X/*`

## Work In Progress
This build is not polished:
* Most of the sprites are "programmer art" with the exception of sprites generously donated by my peers
* No sfx yet
* Expect multiplayer bugs! The mod is untested in multiplayer. I have a decent idea of what might break but I do not want to shoot in the dark.
* Actually, expect bugs in general.. you can track and report issues on the [Github](https://github.com/Priscillalala/Groove_Salad-BreathingUnderwater/issues)
